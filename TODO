- remove the use of eval in the generated test (it is already in develop prereqs)
    -> release this one as a trial.

- accept individual options via their own attributes

- stop having Test::Portability::Files do its own plan

- accept filefinders, and start listing filenames out explicitly
    just like EOL, NoTabs
